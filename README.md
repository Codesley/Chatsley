# Chatsley ðŸ’¬

## Project Description
Chatsley is a real time chat application built using Django. Users are able to create profiles and join chatrooms where they can communicate with each other simultaneously through text-based messaging. I wanted to challenge myself to create a website where you could see real time interaction among multiple people. Having recently learned Django, I chose it as the framework for my project for the vast amount of tools that came alongside it. 

## Technologies Used 
**Python | Django | Tailwind CSS  | HTML | JavaScript**

## Challenges
- Django Setup 
- Deployment 

## Project Findings
- Django is very resourceful when its tools align with your ideas.
- Tailwind CSS is great for quick simple designing.
- Future projects I will most likely lean on React for what I believe is an easier setup. 

## Future Goals
- Personal profile additions (Profile picture, bio, etc.)
- Ability to create chatrooms outside of admin controls
- Media messaging (images, videos, etc.)
- Individual messaging (User to user)
